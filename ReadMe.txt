This is a basic system that implements an asp.net core web API with a generic front page that calls the API to show what is returned. This API can also be called directly through postman in order to see it in a more readable fashion. The system and test are all fairly basic but should show that it works and can be scaled by using config files or by connecting the system to the database. If this is a SQL database I would replace the Models created with either Entity Framework or a custom connector to increase speed but the outputs and looks would be the same with a small refactor to get to that point. Since this is based on JSON outputs and conversions it will work well with most web pages or microservices that use it as a data exchange service. The number of filters that can be added both on the front end as you can see with the JavaScript code or on the backend with additional optional parameters is limitless though I kept those to a minimal amount for the time constraints. 

Thank you for your consideration,
